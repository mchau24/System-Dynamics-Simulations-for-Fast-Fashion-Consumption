# System Dynamics Simulations for Fashion Consumption

## 1. Overview
This project explores consumer behaviour in clothing consumption, focusing on fast fashion's popularity versus sustainable options. Through system dynamics modelling, the long-term effects on spending, savings, and waste generation are analysed, highlighting potential interventions to encourage sustainable choices.

### Problem
The primary problem is the **need for clothes** and this demand is often met through fast fashion purchases. Fast fashion offers low-cost, disposable clothing that fulfils immediate needs but leads to frequent purchases and high waste generation. In contrast, sustainable fashion choices, though more expensive initially, provide longer-lasting value.

### Objective
This model aims to understand and explain the tendency to favour fast fashion over sustainable alternatives and how this behaviour could result in a cycle of continuous purchasing of low-quality clothing, leading to increased expenditure and waste over time, thereby identifying potential interventions to mitigate this. 

To scale down the problem, the model focuses on a simplified case of a university studentâ€™s clothing needs, exploring choices between fast fashion and sustainable options. 

### Data and Assumptions
The data used are hypothetical and based on personal experience. Details on assumptions and data are provided in the report.



## 2. Model Structure
The core problem is captured in a **Causal Loop Diagram (CLD)**, which illustrates the feedback loops involved in meeting the need for clothes.

### Simulation Scenarios
The model simulates two scenarios:
1. **Fast Fashion Scenario**: Frequent, low-cost clothing purchases on long-term savings and waste accumulation.

2. **Sustainable Fashion Scenario**: Illustrates the benefits of investing in durable clothing with a longer lifespan, reducing both spending and waste in the long term.

**Note**: The model files are created in Stella software and provided in `.isdb` and `.stmx` formats, which require Stella to open and run.



## 3. Key Findings
1. **Financial Impact**: Fast fashion may appear economical at first, but the frequent need for replacements increases overall spending. Sustainable choices lead to greater savings over time.
2. **Environmental Impact**: Fast fashion generates significantly more waste due to the short lifespan of items. Sustainable clothing reduces waste by lasting longer and requiring fewer replacements.
3. **Policy Implications**: Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies could reduce waste and make sustainable fashion more accessible by encouraging producers to design for durability.
